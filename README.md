# Digit-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning
 Utilizing MNIST dataset's 60k training and 10k test samples of 28x28 grayscale images, this project employs DNNs for accurate handwritten digit recognition. With balanced digit classes, it aims to build a robust model without data cleaning, focusing on achieving high accuracy.
